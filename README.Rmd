This package is an API wrapper for [National Grid's Carbon Intensity API](https://carbonintensity.org.uk/). The API provides information on national and regional carbon intensity - the amount of carbon emitted per unit of energy consumed - for the UK. 

## Installation

Install the latest CRAN package with: 

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("intensegRid")
```

Or you can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("KKulma/intensegRid")
```

## Examples

For examples on how to use **intensegRid** package refer to the [vignette](https://kkulma.github.io/intensegRid/articles/intro-to-carbon-intensity.html). 

## Limitations

In its current form, the package only accepts dates as `start` or `end` inputs (as Dates or character string), but not timestamps. However you can easily filter the output of **intensegRid** functions using [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) and [lubridate](https://lubridate.tidyverse.org/) packages.

## Contribution
This is an open-source project and it welcomes your contribution! Feel free to use and test the package and if you find a bug, please, report it as [an issue](https://github.com/KKulma/intensegRid/issues). You may want to go even a step further and fix an issue you just raised!

If you're rather new to open source and git, [this repo](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions/blob/master/README.md) offers some easy to follow guidance on how to start. Thanks for your time and efforts!
